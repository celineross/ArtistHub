# ArtistHub

## Description
ArtistHub is a multifunctional platform that allows artists and content creators to create a simple homepage for interacting with their fans! 
Not only can you post all of the information fans will need to find out what type of artist you are and the kind of content you produce, 
but you'll also be able to publish performance dates or other events in an easy-to-read calendar format, up to one year in advance. 
Optionally, merchandise can be posted for sale on a separate merch tab on your individual page! Fans can purchase your products at the click of a button, and as an artist you can easily keep track of inventory stock and other sales figures.

As a fan, you can create a simple user account to post comments on a band's forum page, purchase merchandise, a
nd add bands to your favorites page so you can easily keep track of all their updates, new merchandise, and more.
